ECMAScript

    Specification for Writing JavaScript: ECMAScript is a standard specification that serves as the foundation for writing JavaScript.

JavaScript

    Language Based on ECMAScript: JavaScript is a programming language built on top of ECMAScript specifications.
    JavaScript Compilation: To compile JavaScript, Chrome developed the V8 Engine, which is designed to compile and execute JavaScript.
    Browser Execution: Initially, the only way to run JavaScript was through a browser.
    Web APIs: Functions like setTimeout and fetch are provided by the browser and are called Web APIs. They are not part of the ECMAScript specifications.

Node.js

    JavaScript Outside the Browser: Node.js was developed to allow JavaScript to run outside the browser, making it possible to use JavaScript as a backend language.
    Built on V8 Engine: Node.js includes features such as HTTP, file I/O, and others, built on top of the V8 engine, enabling JavaScript to run on the server side.

Bun

    Node.js Competitor: Bun is another runtime that can execute JavaScript.
    Built with Zig: Unlike Node.js, which is built on top of C or C++, Bun is built using the Zig programming language.
