## Degree & Cardinality
1. **Degree**: The Degree in a relational database means the number of columns that a table contains.
2. **Cardinality**: Cardinality is the number of records or tuples that exists at a particular database instance.
3. Example: For above image: Degree is 4 for user and 3 for Products. Cardinality at that particular instance is 3 for both the tables.
4. Cardinality changes as we insert or remove the records from the table.
