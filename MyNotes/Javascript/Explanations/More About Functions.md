### Passing argument to function in javascript
1. Arguments in javascript is either passed as by value or by reference
2. We we pass primitive values such as strings, numbers, or booleans we are passing the arguments as value. So any modification of that value inside the function will not affect the original variable.
3. Whereas when we pass the non primitive values such as arrays, objects ... We are passing it as reference, which means any modification to the values inside the function will modify the original variable as well.
