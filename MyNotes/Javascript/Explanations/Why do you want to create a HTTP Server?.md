Why do you wand to create a HTTP Server, the moment you start coding a web project?

When we talk about communication between a client and a server, it’s similar to how two people communicate over the phone. Just like a protocol is established between you and the person you're talking to (e.g., speaking the same language, taking turns to talk), communication between a client and a server also requires a protocol.

### What is a Protocol?

A protocol is a set of rules or a standard way of procedure that dictates how data is transmitted and received.

### Example: Phone Communication

When you use your phone to talk to someone, a protocol is established that allows for the exchange of voice data. This protocol ensures both parties understand each other and communicate effectively.

### Communication with a Server

Similarly, when a client (like your web browser) wants to communicate with a server, a protocol is needed. One of the most common protocols for this purpose is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).

- **HTTP**: It’s used for transferring hypertext documents on the web. There are other protocols as well, like:
    - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: For transferring files.
    - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: For sending emails.

HTTP is widely used because it's an industry standard designed specifically for web communication, with properties optimized for transferring hypertext documents.

### HTTP Server

For a client to reach our server, an HTTP server is typically created in the backend. This server listens for HTTP requests from clients (usually through web browsers) and processes those requests using a handler.

### Creating an HTTP Server

There are various ways to create an HTTP server, using different programming languages such as Node.js, Java, or C++.

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to build scalable network applications.
- **Express**: A popular library in Node.js that simplifies the creation of an HTTP server. It is built on top of the HTTP module in Node.js.

Using Express, we can create an HTTP server that efficiently handles client requests. It provides a set of features to build web and mobile applications, making the process of setting up an HTTP server and handling requests straightforward.
