## Intro
- This video is for those who are currently in First year as a Fresher or Second year students and wants to make a career in Software industry. We are always confused what should I do, Development or DSA? Everyone says yeah do both and you will succeed. In this video, I want to address, why learning multiple things at once can affect your journey as a whole. Whereas Mastering one can help you reach your goal easier and faster.
## The Problems with Multitasking
- Let me start by sharing a experience of not only myself but a lot of students who are not consistent in their journey and end up multitasking every time.
- Disclaimer: This video is or those who are not consistent in learning. For example if you are consistent enough to do both DSA and Development at the same time, that's very great. Then that means you are already on the path of success, however, I want to help those who sometimes give up when things gets hard.
- What is Multitasking in general? Basically if a person can execute multiple tasks at a given period of time. Now, you will say, Today I have achieved to practice both DSA and Development. But can you continue this for next 3 Months? If not then you are not efficient in Multitasking.

## Benefits of Focusing on Development
- You should always question yourself , what is it that I want to achieve. Is it that I want to crack a top MNC Company and get a High paying job? Or is it that I want to build a impactful product for the society.
- Let's start with the second one. You are here, because you are passionate about Computers and you find it fascinating when things work a certain way.
